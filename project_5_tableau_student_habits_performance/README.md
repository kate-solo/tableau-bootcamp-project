# Project 5 (Tableau): How Study Habits and Daily Routines Influence Exam Performance

## Overview
This Tableau project explores how students’ study habits, daily routines, and well-being factors influence academic performance.  
The analysis is designed as a story-driven visual investigation, transforming survey data into clear, actionable insights through interactive dashboards and structured storytelling.

The project focuses on identifying the strongest drivers of exam performance and highlighting how multiple lifestyle factors work together rather than in isolation.

---

## Objectives
- Identify the key behavioral drivers of exam performance
- Analyze the impact of study time, screen exposure, and sleep duration
- Explore the role of attendance, mental health, physical activity, and diet quality
- Translate analytical findings into data-driven recommendations

---

## Tableau Content
The project is structured as a **Tableau Story**, consisting of multiple sections:

### 1. Project Overview
Introduces the analytical context and explains the purpose of the study, emphasizing a holistic approach to academic performance.

### 2. Core Drivers of Exam Performance
- **Study Time vs Exam Score**  
  Higher study duration is associated with higher average exam scores.
- **Screen Time vs Exam Score**  
  Increased screen exposure shows a negative relationship with exam performance.
- **Sleep Duration vs Exam Score**  
  Students with adequate sleep achieve higher average scores.

### 3. Sleep and Daily Routines Performance
- Comparison of average exam scores across sleep duration bands
- Distribution analysis showing score consistency by sleep group

### 4. Well-Being and Self-Discipline Factors
- **Attendance and Exam Performance**  
  Higher attendance is linked to slightly better outcomes.
- **Mental Health and Exam Performance**  
  Improved self-reported mental well-being corresponds to higher scores.
- **Physical Activity and Diet Quality**  
  Both factors show moderate but consistent positive relationships with performance.

### 5. Key Analytical Findings
A synthesized summary highlighting the most influential factors affecting exam outcomes.

### 6. Data-Driven Recommendations
Targeted recommendations derived directly from observed patterns:
- For students: balancing study time, sleep, and screen usage
- For institutions: supporting attendance, mental health, and digital well-being

### 7. Final Conclusions
Emphasizes that academic success is not driven by a single factor but by the combined effect of habits, routines, and overall well-being.
