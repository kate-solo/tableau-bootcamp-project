## Analysis Workflow
The analysis follows a structured exploratory approach:

1. **Data Understanding & Cleaning**
   - Inspection of dataset structure and data types
   - Handling missing values and inconsistent entries
   - Feature preparation for analysis

2. **Price & Discount Analysis**
   - Distribution of product prices and discount percentages
   - Identification of categories with aggressive discount strategies
   - Comparison between original and discounted prices

3. **Category-Level Analysis**
   - Average pricing and rating trends by category
   - Identification of high-volume and high-rating categories
   - Variability of discounts across categories

4. **Customer Rating Analysis**
   - Distribution of customer ratings
   - Relationship between ratings and pricing
   - Exploration of review count as an indicator of product popularity

5. **Insight-Driven Visual Analysis**
   - Comparative bar charts and distribution plots
   - Identification of outliers and dominant patterns

## Key Insights
- Discount strategies vary significantly across product categories
- Higher-priced products do not necessarily receive higher customer ratings
- Some categories achieve strong ratings with moderate pricing, indicating higher perceived value
- Customer ratings cluster within a narrow range, suggesting generally positive user feedback
- Aggressive discounting is not always correlated with higher customer satisfaction

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Pandas** — data manipulation and aggregation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** — data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** — exploratory analysis environment
